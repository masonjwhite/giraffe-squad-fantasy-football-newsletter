## Adding a new week

To add a new week to the site, please follow the steps below.

1. Modify the `create-weekly-file` script in the `package.json` to take the week of the file you want to create. (the number after `createDataFile.js`)
2. Run the `create-weekly-file` script
3. To see your page in the site, add your route component and route name in the `src/main.tsx` file.
4. Once ready to publish, change the `CURRENT_PUBLISHED_WEEK` value to your new week in the `src/settings.ts` file.
5. All routing and navigation should be automatically handled for you thanks to some pretty cheeky component design if I do say so myself üòú
6. PUSH, CELEBRATE AND SHARE!
