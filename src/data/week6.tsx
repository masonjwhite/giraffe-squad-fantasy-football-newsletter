      <Paragraph>
        Whether it's Luke Skywalker vs. Darth Vader, Rocky vs. Creed, Harry Potter vs. Voldemort or
        Me vs. Ikea furniture assembly, nothing beats a good showdown.
      </Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>
        Week 6 featured an epic clash between our two favorite scrum masters, Coach Zari of{' '}
        <TeamName teamName="Candace Bergen" /> and Coach Jaime of{' '}
        <TeamName teamName="Jaiwalking to Victory" />.
      </Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>
        Before we go further though, let's define "Scrum Master" for the non-technical folks out
        there (hi Erin, Mom, Dad, Bro-in-law, Auntie Sharon, Josh and Courtney!)
      </Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>
        A Scrum Master is someone who has mastered "scrum", which is the ancient art of herding
        nerdy, disorganized and non-communicative cats.
      </Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>
        Only joking. A Scrum Master is essentially a project manager for a software development
        team. Kinda the same thing though, right?
      </Paragraph>

        caption="Jaime and Zari everytime software engineers start talking about coding"
      />
      <Paragraph>
        So let's answer the question on everyone's mind. Does managing software projects actually
        translate to managing a fictious sports team?

      />
      <Paragraph>
        But there's another storyline brewing here like an overly-pretentious, overly-expensive
        craft beer made by some guy named Clyde at one of your 3,000 local micro breweries...
      </Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>
        Coach Zari has been a mainstay in the league since our inaugural season in 2019. Coach Jaime
        is a rookie embarking on her first fantasy football season ever.
      </Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>It's a classic matchup between new blood and the wily veteran.</Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>
        Before we get to the results, I got a chance to follow up with both of them about the
        showdown.
      </Paragraph>
      <Interview
        interviewerImage={commissionerImg}
        interviewerName="Mason White, Commissioner"
        interviewerQuote="How do you feel your matchup against Zari went? Were you intimidated by facing a 5-year giraffe fantasy football league veteran?"
        intervieweeImage={teams[2].logo}
        intervieweeName="Coach Jaime, Jaiwalking to Victory"
        intervieweeQuote="Intimidated...not at all; I was more concerned I was going to be beat by a team named after 78 yr old woman; that's just embarrassing!"
      />
      <Interview
        interviewerImage={commissionerImg}
        interviewerName="Mason White, Commissioner"
        interviewerQuote="How do you think your matchup against Jaime went?"
        intervieweeImage={teams[1].logo}
        intervieweeName="Coach Zari, Candace Bergen"
        intervieweeQuote="Fantasy Football is all about taking big risks and hoping they play out (and not get injured). Our team is currently held together by scotch tape, Trevor Lawrence's luscious locks, and the ghost of Mac Jones in the Patriots locker room, so we had to shoot for the fences and hope someone had a big game because the bench is a sad mess. They obviously didn't, so next practice everyone including our injured players (looking at you, Pacheco and Mason) will be running extra laps!"
      />
      <Paragraph>So who came away with the dubya?</Paragraph>
      <Image
        src="https://i.giphy.com/media/v1.Y2lkPTc5MGI3NjExZ2plYmNyb2sxeXA5Z2tpcHd4NnJsbDFieHFzcXVldjk2MWkweG5pcCZlcD12MV9pbnRlcm5hbF9naWZfYnlfaWQmY3Q9Zw/v4aN9JGFL62dO/giphy.gif"
        caption="Get it?! Dubya? Please don't make me explain it further..."
      />
      <Paragraph>
        Well, you can call it beginner's luck, a blessing from "Uh Oh Stinky" himself or that
        encouragement stuff she was talking about, but the fact remains that Coach Jaime
        emphatically claimed a Week 6 victory in a blowout 144.9 - 98.1
      </Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>
        If you've been following along, you know that's 4 wins IN A ROW for{' '}
        <TeamName teamName="Jaiwalking to Victory" />.
      </Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>
        Yes, after receiving an actual "F" draft grade and getting smoked like a brisket in the
        first two weeks, Coach Jaime is quite literally...jay walking to victory.
      </Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>
        Now go hug your friendly neighborhood Scrum Master! But make sure you ask first, because
        that could be an HR violation.
