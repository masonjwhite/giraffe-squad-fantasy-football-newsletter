          <b>Super Lamario</b> led the league this week with an impressive <b>158 points</b>, and
          leads all teams in scoring through the first couple of weeks of the season. Yes the
          players did a little but most of the success comes from the coaching of course. We can't
          all have a big brain, and in that spirit, there was potentially an oopsie with the trade
          of <b>Marvin Harrison Jr.</b> to <b>Joey B & The Q-tips</b>. But time will tell... and
          with a strong roster and good performances to start the year, this team takes the top spot
          in our un-biased <b>Power Rankings</b>. For any complaints or grievences with the
          appearances of this selection, please see our "Complaints" link at the bottom of the page.

          It wasn't the finest week for <b>Nacua Matata</b>, who was left in the dust with a lowly{' '}

          to the middle of the pack after posting both the highest score in the opener, and the
          lowest score this week. Which week's performance is the norm and which is the outlier? The
          outlook for this team is very unclear, <b>Anthony Richardson</b> is wildly uneven as a QB,
          and for every improbable highlight reel play he made last week, regression to the norm
          turned those same decisions into a trio of interceptions this week. Coupled with Cooper
          Kupp's injury, and Tank Dell's relegation to WR3 on the Texans, this team seems hard to
          evaluate. It obviously isn't all doom and gloom though - as the fantasy output in week 1
          demonstrated - but finding consistency might be hard for this team.

          <b>Pattibot</b> had a rough week, scoring <b>124 points</b> and losing to{' '}
          <b>Candace Bergen</b> by just 5.84 points. A touchdown would have won this game for
          Jackie's team, who is still looking for their first win. But with a strong roster and an
          easier upcoming schedule, I still believe in this squad.

          Shrinkflation is very real. <b>Jaiwalking to Victory</b>'s "name-brand" players in Patrick
          Mahomes and Taylor Swift's Boyfriend haven't lifted a finger to help her this year. This
          game was looking to be down-to-the-wire with <b>Mason</b>, but a no-show performance from
          rookie <b>Keon Coleman</b>, who failed to record a single catch, sealed the deal for
          Jaime. I was tempted to keep this team in the Uh Oh Stinky basement, but Jaime loves her
          metrics, and the numbers show she has scored more points than <b>Adam</b>. Also - with
          just terrible luck of the draw, Jaime's opponents have scored <b>300</b> points against
          her in 2 weeks, the most by far and nearly double the amount of total points scored
          against <b>Joe</b>'s team.

      <Paragraph>Welcome to the Week 2 Fantasy Newsletter, Britney Army!</Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>
        Am I going to cram every lyric to "Oops I did it Again" into one article?
      </Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>Let's just say...</Paragraph>
      <Image src="https://media.giphy.com/media/JoVB2SzGWJojVtIZQs/giphy.gif?cid=790b7611cwsa3yx04vd6v1385vy9insamw0cggehgw79z9e0&ep=v1_gifs_search&rid=giphy.gif&ct=g" />
      <Paragraph>
        This week we're talking injuries. And dang have there been a lot of them! Actually, come to
        think of it, there might be more notable players hurt than "Dynamic Kickoff" returns so far.
      </Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>
        First, we saw Jordan Love hit the "grass" in Sao Paulo. Puka Nacua's knee said "football is
        death". Kenneth Walker III's injury status became "oh...bleek". Keenan Allen learned the
        "heel" command. Evan Engram didn't want to be associated with the Jaguars this season (who
        can blame him?). Tee Higgins still hasn't "tee'd" off yet. Raheem Mostert decided that
        De'Von Achane would handle "most ert" the carries for the first part of the season. And AJ
        Brown's hamstring didn't want to go up against primetime Kirk Cousins.
      </Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>
        Then Week 2 "made me lose all my senses". We saw Tua Tagovailoa have yet another vicious
        concussion on Thursday night (no joke for this one folks, too serious). Marquise "Hollywood"
        Brown decided that he would go on a writer's strike. Isiah Pacheco took the pregame "break a
        leg" well wishes a little TOO seriously. And Cooper Kupp's ankle decided that it had been
        shown up enough by Marvin Harrison Jr for one day.
      </Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>
        With all these injuries abound, its affected just about everyone. I had a chance to
        interview one of our resident cheeseheads, Joe, about the devastating loss of Jordan Love.
      </Paragraph>
      <Interview
        interviewerName="Mason White, Commissioner"
        interviewerQuote={
          "Have you hear about Green Bay's newest dating show \"Lost Love\"? What're your thoughts on Jordan Love's injury as one of our resident Green Bay fans?"
        }
        interviewerImage={commissionerImg}
        intervieweeName="Coach Joe, Purdy Good"
        intervieweeQuote="When it first happened last week, I thought our season was over. We lost the game and Love looked to be done for the year. Then things started turning around - It was only a sprain and then Josh Jacobs ran over the Colts. Just have to keep it close until Love gets back and Superbowl here we come!"
        intervieweeImage={teams[2].logo}
      />
      <Paragraph>
        Great attitude Joe! Let's hope that "Lost Love" is only a limited series, and not a
        multi-season affair.
      </Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>
        Coach Kara of <TeamName teamName="Pukamon" />, is also dealing with a key player being hurt,
        her team's namesake: Puka Nacua.
      </Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>
        I asked her how she's been dealing with the situation and whether or not she'll change her
        team's name.
      </Paragraph>
      <Interview
        interviewerName="Mason White, Commissioner"
        interviewerQuote="With your namesake Puka Nacua being injured long term, are you considering re-branding your team?"
        interviewerImage={commissionerImg}
        intervieweeName="Coach Kara, Pukamon"
        intervieweeQuote="No, not at all. He's spending a few weeks healing up at the Pukacenter and will be back in action later this season. Pukachu, I choose you! I'm out of pokemon puns now..."
        intervieweeImage={teams[5].logo}
      />
      <Paragraph>
        Finally, when I heard the news that Christian McCaffrey was going on the IR yet again, the
        first thing I thought of was the chorus of Britney Spears' 2000 mega hit "Oops I did it
        Again".
      </Paragraph>
      <Exposition text="Oops, I did it again, I played with your heart, got lost in the game" />
      <Paragraph>Dang. That pretty much sums it up.</Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>
        Each year, millions of fantasy coaches are faced with the same difficult choice: "To draft
        McCaffrey or not to draft McCaffrey?". And each year they're either treated to an absolute
        wrecking ball of a running back or they "cry watching the days" until the season is over.
      </Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>
        Now what if I told you the coach who had to make that decision this year ALSO has 3 other
        injured starting players?
      </Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>
        That is the unfortunate fate of Zac Fermanis, coach of the aptly named{' '}
        <TeamName teamName="Highly Questionable" />
      </Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>
        I was able to snag him for a second when he wasn't busy trawling the waiver wire.
