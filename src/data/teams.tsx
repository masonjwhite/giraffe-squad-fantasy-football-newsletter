          <Text size="xl">Coach Nick (ChadFish) Bradfish is the leagues only remaining perfect team, and he just might cement himself in Giraffe fantasy football history unless someone can topple him. No one has been able to stress test this team to the point of failure, and that may not change anytime soon, with reinforcements arriving this week - in the form of versatile running back Alvin Kamara. Nick's team will take one last step in reaching its future state architecture when Cooper Kupp RTOs from injury. This team has shown it can win, but can it win with purpose? And can it do it together? Time will tell.</Text>

    <Text size="xl">Making their debut in the top 5 last week, Jackie's team continues to rise in the Power Rankings with their most recent victory, this time - the team even started a player in every position! Definitley one of the biggest innovations in football since the creation of the forward pass. Armed with the knowledge that playing more players means scoring more points, Jackie may be close to unstoppable this season, boasting excellent skill position players. Christian Watson will be interesting to keep an eye on as he returns from injury and builds chemistry with Jordan Love. We were able to catchup with coach Jackie postgame: </Text>

      I do believe there was a high correlation to having players in every position and winning. Not to toot my own horn but it was the first week when I won in all three of my fantasy leagues, so definitely riding that high! I'm sure it will coem back to bit em ein this upcoming week, I'm projected to win but my confidence in the predictions are low. Going to hope Taylor Swift and all the A-list celebrities keep coming to the Chiefs games to ensure Mahomes keeps up his performance.

Her league high 166 points was spearheaded by standout Puca Nacua, who set the rookie record for receptions in 4 games.

This team has flown under the radar this year, having an exceptionally average season. They've scored the 7th most and allowed the 6th most points to date. Even their team's chess ELO score is 1000.6 (average is 1000). They may not bring home any hardware this winter, but this team is setting out to achieve something no one ever has before.

Zac's team had fallen unmanaged the last 2 weeks and was soundly beaten as injured players were left rostered. But apparently neglect isn't as harmful as mismanaged dysfunction, as VisiGoffs whooped CeeDee Phone Home in this weeks outing. I better not see Deebo Samuel or George Kittle on the team plane home. They can Uber back to California. They scored 2.5 points COMBINED. It's a disgrace I don't wanna talk about it. </Text>

  <Title order={3}>Florida Man Loses Fantasy but Wins Reality </Title>
  <Text size="xl">Fantasy football was probably the last thing on coach Mason and his team's mind this weekend as he tied the knot! Headed down to Florida for his honeymoon, the Jaguar King loses his first game as a Florida Man. Average Joes were feeling generous, but picked a gift off the registry in the form of 26 points from Justin Jefferson. Russel Wilson catered the event, but for once letting Russ cook didn't end in disaster as he served up 22 fantasy points of his own. This matchup also saw an epic showdown between tight ends, as Dawson Knox and Luke Musgrave duked it out in a clash to see who could be more useless for fantasy owners. In the end Musgrave came out victorious scoring 1.1 points (1 reception for 1 yards) compared to Knox's monster afternoon of 2.2 points (1 catch 12 yards)  </Text>

   <Text size="xl">A shocking win last week over Henry's Hustle jumped this team a couple spots in these rankings. Any Given Sunday has been leaned on star running back Christian McCaffrey to this point in the season and he has delivered a string of unbelievable performances. McCaffrey has been the clear steal of the draft in hindsight, and at this point just needs any help he can get from the rest of the team. If Kristen can inspire second running back AJ Dillon to play competently as an average performer, McCaffrey can do the rest and drag this squad to the playoffs. A win this week over Pattibot would go a long way in proving this team is a contender, not a pretedner.</Text>

DakStreet Boys is favored but anything can happen. David's RB Breece Hall is reportedly off his snap-count this week as it marks the anniversery of his ACL injury.
